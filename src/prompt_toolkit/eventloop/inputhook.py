"""
Similar to `PyOS_InputHook` of the Python API, we can plug in an input hook in
the asyncio event loop.

The way this works is by using a custom 'selector' that runs the other event
loop until the real selector is ready.

It's the responsibility of this event hook to return when there is input ready.
There are two ways to detect when input is ready:

The inputhook itself is a callable that receives an `InputHookContext`. This
callable should run the other event loop, and return when the main loop has
stuff to do. There are two ways to detect when to return:

- Call the `input_is_ready` method periodically. Quit when this returns `True`.

- Add the `fileno` as a watch to the external eventloop. Quit when file descriptor
  becomes readable. (But don't read from it.)

  Note that this is not the same as checking for `sys.stdin.fileno()`. The
  eventloop of prompt-toolkit allows thread-based executors, for example for
  asynchronous autocompletion. When the completion for instance is ready, we
  also want prompt-toolkit to gain control again in order to display that.

In the provided code snippet from the file src/prompt_toolkit/eventloop/inputhook.py, the following improvements and corrections can be made:

1. Ensure consistent naming conventions for variables and functions for better code clarity.
2. Validate the use of type annotations and ensure they accurately represent the expected types.
3. Add more detailed comments to explain the purpose and usage of each function and class.
4. Consider refactoring the `select` method in `InputHookSelector` class for better readability and maintainability.
5. Check for any potential edge cases or error handling scenarios that need to be addressed.
6. Consider updating the deprecated `set_eventloop_with_inputhook` function to provide a warning or alternative solution.
7. Review the usage of threads and ensure thread safety where necessary.
8. Validate the resource cleanup process in the `close` method to prevent resource leaks.
9. Consider adding more examples or use cases to demonstrate the functionality of the input hook selector.

By implementing these changes, the code will be more structured, easier to understand, and maintainable, ensuring smooth integration of input hooks in the event loop.
